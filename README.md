A deep CNN autoencoder combines the power of CNNs for spatial feature extraction and the reconstruction capabilities of autoencoders to learn efficient representations of input data. It can be used for various applications where learning compact and meaningful representations is essential. Here we have seen the application  of autoencoder for image compression and denoising
The advantage of using a deep CNN in the autoencoder architecture for image compression is that it can capture spatial dependencies and extract meaningful features from the input image. The convolutional layers in the encoder network perform local feature extraction, capturing fine details and patterns. The decoder network uses transposed convolutional layers to upsample the compressed representation and reconstruct the image with improved resolution. The deep CNN architecture helps preserve important image features during compression and ensures higher-quality reconstruction compared to traditional methods
Similar to image compression, the deep CNN architecture in the autoencoder is advantageous for image denoising as it can capture complex spatial patterns and extract hierarchical features. The convolutional layers in the network can identify noise patterns and suppress them, allowing the decoder network to reconstruct a cleaner version of the image.
